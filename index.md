Using a chronic kidney disease dataset from [Kaggle]https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/chronic-kidney-disease, predictions have been made on patients' kidney data to determine whether there are any clear indications of chronic kidney disease.

## 1. Introduction
A few years ago during pregnancy I was placed in the high risk group due to raised blood pressure (gestational hypertension). Ten days after birth my blood pressure rose even higher and it was determined to be preeclampsia; pronounced [pree路uh路klamp路see路uh]. Left untreated preeclampsia can lead to organ failure; in particular to the liver and kidneys.

This data science project will be to investigate kidney data to predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease. The expectation is that the results of this project could be used to benefit people who have had their blood taken in hospital; features of their blood could be used in a model to identify chronic kidney disease which may not have been previously picked up. If I knew my equivalent data I could predict my likelihood of having this disease since having preeclampsia.

A few models will be tried, starting with logistic regression since it is used to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable (disease present or not) and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables. The metrics used to measure the performance of the models will be predictions on the test data, score/classification accuracy, and a confusion matrix.

<a name="questions"></a>
## 3. Questions
1. Can we predict chronic kidney disease from the features in the dataset?
1. Which features are key to the predictions?
1. Which is the best model to use and why?

<a name="findings"></a>
## 4. Findings
### Analysis
There is a step-by-step guide to the results below in the Jupyter notebook. Please take a look.
The feature engineering involved coercing columns to numerical format and removing outliers from columns which were not categorical. Removing categorical outliers meant a lost of vital details in the blood data, such as the level of blood sugar (0-5). 


#### Important Features
The heatmap below shows the relationships between features and the target ('classification').
The features 'packed cell volume' and 'hemoglobin' mostly correlate with each other, and the feature 'serum creatine' most positively correlates with having chronic kidney disease.

Packed cell volume is the the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood.
Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs. Low hemoglobin levels means you have a low red blood cell count (anemia).

It makes sense that these show correlation as they both refer to the number of red blood cells in the blood.

----

The frequency plot below shows that the lower the serum creatine the less likely you are to have chronic kidney disease.
This makes sense as healthy kidneys are known to filter creatinine and other waste products from our blood.

----

A ranking of the models applied to the data according to the scores they produced.
From the below table, we can see that Decision Tree and Random Forest classfiers have the highest accuracy score.

Among these two, the Random Forest classifier is a better choice as it has the ability to limit overfitting when compared to the Decision Tree classifier.

Chronic kidney disease can be predicted 100% from the provided dataset using the Random Forest Classifier. It's confusion matrix is shown below.

### Building the models

A few models were tried to check for the best model to predict chronic kidney disease.
They successfully made predictions.

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Linear SVC
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

The best of the six were coded as:
```
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_random_forest = clf.predict(X_test)
acc_random_forest = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
print (acc_random_forest)
```
```
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_decision_tree = clf.predict(X_test)
acc_decision_tree = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)
print (acc_decision_tree)
```

## 5. Conclusion
Chronic kidney disease can be predicted 100% from the provided dataset using the Random Forest Classifier.
The feature most correlated to this prediction is serum creatinine, which makes sense as healthy kidneys are known to filter creatinine and other waste products from our blood.

#### Reflections
The Random Forest and Decision tree classifiers performed best in the group of models used to predict chronic kidney disease from patient data.

Removing the outliers needed some reflection as a few variables were categorical and it did not make sense to remove some of those categories. Some careful consideration was required and it paid off in the performance of the logistic regression. However in the end that was not the best model as I expected. The Random Forest classifier was best due to it's ability to limit overfitting.

#### Improvements
There was not much open data found for kidney disease, but if it was found in abundance then the chosen model may change due to considerations of performance time, and more parameters would be tested to ensure the performance was optimal.
